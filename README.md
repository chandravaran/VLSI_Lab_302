# VLSI_Lab_302
Repository containing lab experiment results done on NG spice, as well as final project

## Experiment 1
### Objective
Study the Input and Output characteristics of NMOS Transistor, effects of L, W, VTO, LAMBDA, VSB, and temperature on the behavious of the transistor.

## Experiment 2
### Objective
Study the transfer function, Noise margin, effect on risetime, falltime, propagation delay, power and energy consumed of the MOS Inverter for various L, W of the transistor, load capacitance and rise/fall time of input.

## Experiment 3
### Objective
Study the transfer function, Noise margin, effect on rise time, falltime, propagation delay, and the power and energy consumed of a MOS inverter for various L, W of the pull up pull down network, and energy consumed in non ideal step input, for a MOS inverter with active load - NMOS and PMOS.


## Experiment 4
### Objective
Study the transfer function, Noise margin, effect on risetime, falltime, propagation delay, power and energy consumed of the CMOS Inverter for various L, W of the pullup and pulldown transistors. Also power and energey consumed with non-ideal step input.
